## Project Summary
We design a data flow to implement a Proxy Meants Test (PMT) to classify poverty status into 4 categories. This work uses a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data) including partially cleaned data from the Inter-american Development Bank (IDB) on Costa Rican households. 

Our complete approach and details are available in a project report linked in this repo.
