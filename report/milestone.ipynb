    "\n",
    "This report describes our current progress to complete the CAPP 30254 proxy means test project. In our first two weeks, we've conducted a series of data exploration exercises to better define our training data as well as determined what our approach will be to implement and compare a set of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be to use a set of .py functions to analyze the data and create 3 candidate datasets to each contribute to the cleaning process. Then, we will create a data pipeline to train and evaluate the efficacy of 4 models we have covered in class:\n",
    "- Regression forests of some variety (XGBoost, standard CART)\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- Penalized multinomial logistic regressions of some variety (Elastic net, LASSO, etc.)\n",
    "- A simple Neural Net\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate these models based on the model evaluation criteria we will learn in the remaining weeks of the course, likely focusing on predictive accuracy, not computation time due to the relatively smaller size of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 | Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data exploration has focued on understanding the underlying dataset. The data comes from a [2017 ILO survey administered](https://webapps.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog/7230/related-materials) by the Intra-American Development Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is drawn from a nationally representative household survey and includes a subset of household- and individual-level variables that are cleaned by the IDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our main focus has been data quality assurance and data management. We have:\n",
    "- Loaded the data into Python;\n",
    "- Removed extraneous variables created by the IDB such as squared age that are fully dependent on underlying data from respondents. \n",
    "- Reviewed the survey documentation to understand the data generation process.\n",
    "- Evaluated data quality on missingness, item nonresponse, and \n",
    "- Created a development and training data split so that our internal analysis of missing\n",

This assumes that the survey data contains a lot of noisy variables and attempts to select candidate variables most strongly associated with underlying proxies for poverty status: liquid and illiquid wealth, income, income potential, and resilience.\n",
    "1. **Complicated household-level dataset**: Keeping the data at the household-level, we will generate features from the individual-level data and a set of more complex interactions between candidate features.\n",
    "1. **Respondent-level dataset**: We will make individual predictions of poverty status based on individuals in each household and then train weights for the predictions for a composite. This will take advantage of variance in responses among household members in the survey to take advantage of predictors of non-classical measurement error associated with respondent differences.\n",
